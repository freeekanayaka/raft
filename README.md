History
-------

This library is a fork of [Canonical's](https://github.com/canonical/raft) Raft
implementation, which was originally written by this library's author
[himself](https://github.com/canonical/raft/commits?author=freeekanayaka) while
working at Canonical.

It is a **fully compatible drop-in replacement** of Canonical's version, at up
to v0.18.1.

License
-------

This raft C library is released under a slightly modified version of LGPLv3,
that includes a copyright exception letting users to statically link the library

Credits
-------

Of course the biggest thanks goes to Diego Ongaro :) (the original author of the
Raft dissertation).

A lot of ideas and inspiration was taken from other Raft implementations such
as:

- CoreOS' Go implementation for [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/raft)
- Hashicorp's Go [raft](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft)
- Willem's [C implementation](https://github.com/willemt/raft)
- LogCabin's [C++ implementation](https://github.com/logcabin/logcabin)
